- [ ] refactor "screen" into 1) "screenbuffer" (functions for manipulating a
  screen buffer) 2) "sdl" (functions for dealing with SDL).  A screenbuffer
  should provide a "flush" function for flushing the current buffer onto the
  screen when necessary.  This allows the VM some level of control over how
  many instructions to execute per frame.  The screenbuffer will have a
  configurable frame rate.  We'll see how this goes: we may need to further
  decouple framerate from VM clock speed depending on how things go.

- [ ] write a "parser" module which will be responsible for reading in binary
  programs and parsing the commands into structs created by...

- [ ] "vm" a module responsible for executing various commands.  vm requires
  two interfaces: 1) a reader (which provides instructions) and 2) a
  screenbuffer (to write to).

- [ ] main should then just be glue code.
